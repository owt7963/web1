  <h2>What is WEB?</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web, commonly known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.</p>
  <p>
  Web resources may be any type of downloadable media. However, web pages are annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) formatting. Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks which permits users to navigate between web pages. In addition to text, hypertext web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content. Multiple web resources with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Websites are stored in computers which are running a program called a web server which responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on user's computers.</p>
  <p>
  Website content can be largely provided by a publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon the users or their actions, or they may allow direct control and monitoring of equipment. Websites may be provided for myriad informative, entertainment, commercial, governmental, or non-governmental reasons.</p>
  <p>
  English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991. Since that time the World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is a primary tool billions of people use to interact over the Internet.</p>
